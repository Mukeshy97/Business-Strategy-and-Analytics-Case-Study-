        "For example:  **When Keki Mistry (Vice chairman and CEO of HDFC) was asked about the customer default credit card he stated See, what you must understand is that in the last one year or little more than one year it is not possible for us to physically meet any customer. So, all collection effort is done on the phone or the customer would have given us a mandate and like based on that mandate we would debit his account. If for whatever reason that mandate bounces, then we normally would physically meet the customer, which we cannot do now. The second is as I mentioned earlier, courts have stopped any secured lender from taking action against the property. So, you can't go to SARFAESI action. So, that creates a little bit of I would say complacency on the part of a customer. I would say these are the two attributes. \n",

        "3.\tFor Internal Factors, we can provide them some more time for the defaulters to make payments. For external factors, we can give some relaxation on the interest accumulating on the unpaid credits. For global factors, most probability is that it is an industry wise phenomenon that means a pandemic or economic crisis takes down every organization.\n"

We can also give them new loans on lower interests if they can come up with new business ideas. In the present pandemic crisis we can also understand the SME (shopkeeper) like medical, food marketing and medical import and export organizations are doing well so we can try to sell our new credit cards to them for recovering our 100 basis points.  \n"
